#Node.js Beyond web apps

This presentation was a presented at sthlm.js meetup #19 hosted by [Fuffr](http://fuffr.com/) and [NoPicnic](http://nopicnic.com/).

This talk will focus on why and how to use Node.js other than as a Rails replacement. 
Instead how it can be used to build APIs, CLIs, tools and what ever you want.
